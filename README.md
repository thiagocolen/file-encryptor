# 🔐 File Encryptor

A lightweight **Node.js** CLI tool that **encrypts** and **decrypts** all files inside a folder (including subfolders) using **AES-256-GCM** — one of the strongest symmetric encryption algorithms available.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **AES-256-GCM** encryption with authenticated encryption (tamper-proof)
- 🔑 **Password-based key derivation** using `scrypt` (resistant to brute-force)
- 📁 **Recursive folder processing** — handles nested subdirectories automatically
- 🗑️ **Auto-cleanup** — original files are deleted after encryption; `.enc` files are deleted after decryption
- 🚫 **No external dependencies** — uses only Node.js built-in modules (`crypto`, `fs`, `path`, `readline`)

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| **Node.js** | `>= 14.x` |
| **npm**     | `>= 6.x`  |

> [!NOTE]
> No `npm install` is required — the project has **zero dependencies**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/file-encryptor.git
cd file-encryptor
```

### 2️⃣ Place your files

Put the files you want to encrypt/decrypt inside the `./target-folder` directory. Subfolders are supported.

```
target-folder/
├── my-notes.txt
├── secrets/
│   ├── passwords.txt
│   └── keys.json
└── docs/
    └── plan.md
```

### 3️⃣ Encrypt all files

```bash
npm run encrypt
```

You'll be prompted for a password:

```
Enter password: ********
✔ Encrypted: target-folder/my-notes.txt
✔ Encrypted: target-folder/secrets/passwords.txt
✔ Encrypted: target-folder/secrets/keys.json
✔ Encrypted: target-folder/docs/plan.md

🔒 All files encrypted.
```

After encryption, original files are replaced with `.enc` files:

```
target-folder/
├── my-notes.txt.enc
├── secrets/
│   ├── passwords.txt.enc
│   └── keys.json.enc
└── docs/
    └── plan.md.enc
```

### 4️⃣ Decrypt all files

```bash
npm run decrypt
```

Enter the **same password** used during encryption:

```
Enter password: ********
✔ Decrypted: target-folder/my-notes.txt.enc
✔ Decrypted: target-folder/secrets/passwords.txt.enc
✔ Decrypted: target-folder/secrets/keys.json.enc
✔ Decrypted: target-folder/docs/plan.md.enc

🔓 All files decrypted.
```

## 🛠️ NPM Scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `encrypt` | `npm run encrypt` | 🔒 Encrypts all files in `./target-folder` |
| `decrypt` | `npm run decrypt` | 🔓 Decrypts all `.enc` files in `./target-folder` |

---

## 🤖 Agentic Workflow Integration

This tool is designed to be easily integrated into autonomous agent workflows (like **Gemini CLI**).

### 🔑 Non-Interactive Mode
To avoid interactive password prompts, use the `FILE_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD` environment variable.

```bash
# Set password in environment
export FILE_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD="your-strong-password"

# Run without prompt
node index.js encrypt ./my-data
```

### 📊 JSON Output
Use the `--json` flag to receive structured output. This will suppress all standard progress messages and return a single JSON object.

```bash
node index.js encrypt ./my-data --json
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{ "status": "success", "mode": "encrypt", "folder": "/path/to/my-data" }
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{ "error": "FILE_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD environment variable is required for --json mode." }
```

## ⚓ Git Pre-commit Hook

You can automate the encryption of all files in your repository right before every commit. This ensures that your local files are always encrypted before they are staged and committed to version control.

### 1️⃣ Set the Environment Variable
The hook requires the `FILE_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD` to be set in your environment.

```bash
export FILE_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD="your-strong-password"
```

### 2️⃣ Install the Hook
Copy the provided `pre-commit` script to your `.git/hooks` directory and make it executable.

```bash
cp hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### 3️⃣ How it Works
When you run `git commit`, the hook will:
1.  Check for the `FILE_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD` environment variable.
2.  Automatically run `node index.js encrypt .` (ignoring `.git` and `node_modules`).
3.  Automatically stage the newly created `.enc` files.

## 🔧 How It Works — Technical Details

### 🧬 Encryption Algorithm

| Parameter       | Value           |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Algorithm**   | `AES-256-GCM`  |
| **Key Length**   | 32 bytes (256 bits) |
| **IV Length**    | 16 bytes (128 bits) |
| **Salt Length**  | 16 bytes        |
| **Auth Tag**     | 16 bytes        |
| **Key Derivation** | `scrypt`     |

### 🗂️ Encrypted File Format

Each `.enc` file stores all the data needed for decryption in a single binary blob:

```
┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────────┬──────────────────┐
│  Salt    │   IV     │  Auth Tag    │  Encrypted Data  │
│ 16 bytes │ 16 bytes │  16 bytes    │  N bytes         │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

### 🔄 Process Flow

```
ENCRYPTION:
  Password → scrypt(salt) → Key
  Plaintext + Key + IV → AES-256-GCM → Ciphertext + AuthTag
  Output: salt | iv | authTag | ciphertext → file.enc

DECRYPTION:
  Read .enc file → extract salt, iv, authTag, ciphertext
  Password → scrypt(salt) → Key
  Ciphertext + Key + IV + AuthTag → AES-256-GCM → Plaintext
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

> [!CAUTION]
> **Don't forget your password!** There is no way to recover encrypted files if you lose your password. The encryption is irreversible without it.

> [!WARNING]
> **Original files are deleted** after encryption. Make sure you have backups before running the encrypt command for the first time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Same password required** — You must use the exact same password for decryption that was used during encryption. A wrong password will result in an authentication error.

## 🛡️ Security Overview

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM (military-grade, authenticated) |
| **Key Derivation** | scrypt (memory-hard, resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks) |
| **Random Salt** | Unique per file — same password produces different ciphertext |
| **Random IV** | Unique per file — prevents pattern analysis |
| **Auth Tag** | Ensures integrity — detects any tampering |
